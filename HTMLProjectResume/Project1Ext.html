<br><br>
<p>You already know that I am a Youtuber, Game Designer, Music Composer, and just overall an insane amount of things. My life is never at a standstill since goals don't come to you. You come to those goals. But what are those goals? Put Simply <b>My Life Goal Is To Entertain As Many People As I Can</b></p>
    <p>Which is why I devote my time to all of these things that I do.</p>
    <p>Recentely I have been working on a major project where I am the lead manager of around 100 people as I work to revive a game that was cancelled, with this large team. We have decided that our first prototype is due on 9/30/2025, so I have been hard at work getting everything in order.</p>
